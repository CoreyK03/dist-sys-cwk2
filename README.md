# Distributed Systems Coureswork 2 Serverless Workflow

This repository contains the code written for Coursework 2 of COMP3211 Distributed Systems.

The script `function_app.py` contains Azure Functions designed to simulate the practical challenge of monitoring the environmental conditions of a scalable number of fish tanks in a tropical fish shop. This workflow showcases the application of Azure serverless functions for real-time monitoring and aggregation of sensor data, in the context of ensuring stable and healthy conditions of aquatic environments. In such a setting, scalability and availability of a solution is important, due to the importance of environment monitoring and the potential for continual addition of fish tanks with business growth.

## Azure Functions

1. Time-triggered Data Simulation Function
2. SQL-triggered Data Aggregation Function
3. HTTP-triggered Raw Data API Endpoint
4. HTTP-triggered Aggregated Data API Endpoint
